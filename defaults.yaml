# Language extensions that should be turned on by default in each source file
# These are things that are either tiny utilities that would be too much of a
# hassle to turn on individually (like TypeApplications, ViewPatterns or MultiWayIf) or pretty
# much are arguably "bugfixes" (like ScopedTypeVariables and NegativeLiterals which basically just
# change the behaviour to what most people would expect anyway).
#
# Note: I use pretty much the same list across all my projects, this doesn't
# necessarily mean that all of these are actually being used here!
